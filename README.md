# Will Durney's Dotfiles

This repo contains some of my personal customizations for developing in OSX. In addition to my main
vim configuration, there's a "slimmed-down" vim config file for use on systems where you don't
intend to do long-term development, such as a production server.

## Installation:

To install, clone the repo and run the included build script. The build script is nondestructive;
you'll be prompted to replace existing dotfiles with symlinks.

```
git clone git@github.com:willdurney/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
