# Will Durney's Dotfiles

This repo contains some of my personal customizations for developing in OSX. In addition to my main
vim configuration, there's a "slimmed-down" vim config file for use on systems where you don't
intend to do long-term development, such as a production server.

## Installation:

To install, clone the repo then run the included install script to create the appropriate symlinks.
Be sure to back up any of your existing dotfiles that would be overridden.

```
git clone git@github.com:futurityverb/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/install.sh
```
